Complete Syllabus: xUnit for .NET
Module 1: Introduction
What is Unit Testing?
Overview of xUnit framework
Comparison with MSTest & NUnit
Setting up xUnit in a .NET solution
Using CLI (dotnet new xunit) & IDE (Visual Studio, Rider, VS Code)

Module 2: Writing Basic Tests
[Fact] attribute (basic tests)
Assertion methods (Assert.Equal, Assert.NotNull, Assert.Throws, etc.)
Test project structure & naming conventions
Arrange–Act–Assert pattern

Module 3: Parameterized & Data-Driven Tests
[Theory] attribute
[InlineData] for simple parameterized tests
[MemberData] and [ClassData] for complex test data
Reusing test data across multiple test methods

Module 4: Test Lifecycle & Organization
Test class constructor for setup
IDisposable for teardown
IClassFixture<T> and CollectionFixture<T> for shared context
Test collections & grouping tests
Skipping tests with [Fact(Skip = "...")]

Module 5: Advanced Testing Techniques
Async test methods (async Task)
Testing exceptions & edge cases
Custom test display names
Controlling test execution order
Parallel test execution (default behavior in xUnit)

Module 6: Dependency Injection & Mocking
Constructor injection in test classes
Mocking with Moq or other frameworks
Stubbing external dependencies (APIs, DBs, file system)
Using InMemoryDatabase for EF Core testing

Module 7: Integration with .NET Projects
Writing tests for:
Service classes
Repository classes (EF Core)
Web API Controllers
Testing Middleware & Filters
Testing with HTTPClient and TestServer

Module 8: Code Coverage & Reporting
Measuring coverage with Coverlet
Generating reports (HTML, Cobertura, lcov)
Integrating with Visual Studio Code Coverage
Enforcing coverage thresholds

Module 9: Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)
Running dotnet test in pipelines (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, GitLab CI)
Test filtering and categories in pipelines
Publishing test results & coverage in CI
Best practices for automated testing in DevOps

Module 10: Best Practices & Patterns
Naming conventions (Method_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior)
